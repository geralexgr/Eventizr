# Eventizr
A cross platform mobile app built with Xamarin using Facebook's Graph API


After the recent Facebook changes about data and how they can be accessed by applications, developers cannot longer get public facebook events for pages and venues. As a result eventizr, an app that used facebook graph api in order to get events and present them to the user, cannot longer function as intented.

[Facebook Pages\Events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/events/)

Some of the Xamarin features that app uses:

* MVVM design
* Xamarin.Forms.Maps
* Messaging plugin
* Rest calls
* Facebook Graph API
* Connectivity plugin
* SQLite database
* Settings plugin
* Google Ads
* Analytics
